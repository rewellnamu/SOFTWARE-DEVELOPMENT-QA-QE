The asyncHandler function is an essential utility in Express.js applications that ensures robust error handling in asynchronous route handlers. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it's important:

1. Asynchronous Operations in Express
Express.js allows defining route handlers that can perform asynchronous operations like:

Interacting with a database (e.g., fetching user data from PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
Making API requests (e.g., fetching data from third-party services).
Processing files or performing computations asynchronously.
In these scenarios, JavaScript Promises and async/await are commonly used.

2. Problem: Uncaught Errors Can Crash the Server
One of the biggest challenges with asynchronous functions in Express route handlers is error propagation. If an error occurs in an asynchronous function and is not properly handled, it can result in:

The Express server crashing due to an unhandled Promise rejection.
The request hanging indefinitely because the route handler never calls next() to proceed to the next middleware.
Security risks if sensitive errors are leaked to the client due to improper error handling

app.get("/user/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUserById(req.params.id); // If this fails, the error isn't caught
  res.json(user);
});

If getUserById throws an error (e.g., the database is unreachable), Express does not automatically catch it, leading to an unhandled promise rejection.

3. Solution: The asyncHandler Utility
The asyncHandler function acts as a wrapper around asynchronous route handlers, ensuring that any errors are automatically forwarded to Expressâ€™s error-handling middleware.

const asyncHandler = <T = any>(
  fn: (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => Promise<T>
) => {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);
  };
};


Key Benefits
Ensures Proper Error Handling
Any error that occurs in the wrapped async function is automatically passed to next(), which then gets handled by Express's built-in or custom error-handling middleware.

Prevents Server Crashes
Without proper error handling, unhandled promise rejections can cause the server to terminate. This utility prevents that.
Cleaner Code with Less Boilerplate

Eliminates the need for manually wrapping every route with try-catch blocks
