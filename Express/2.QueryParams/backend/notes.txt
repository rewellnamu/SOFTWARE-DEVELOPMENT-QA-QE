📌 What Are Query Parameters?
Query parameters are key-value pairs sent in the URL to provide optional information to the server. They are typically used for:

Filtering (e.g., fetch events by location)
Sorting (e.g., sort events by price)
Pagination (e.g., get events for page 2)
Search queries (e.g., find events with "concert" in the title)
✅ Query parameters always come after the ? in a URL and multiple parameters are separated by &.


1️⃣ Performance Optimization (Reduce Data Transfer)
If we filter on the frontend, the server sends all data to the client.
If we filter on the backend, the server only sends the relevant data.
📌 Example

Frontend filtering: Fetch 100,000 events from the server and filter on the client → Slow!
Backend filtering: Fetch only 10 relevant events based on a query → Much faster!
🔹 Less data = Faster page load & better performance!

2️⃣ Reduced Bandwidth Usage
Sending unfiltered data to the frontend increases network traffic.
Backend filtering minimizes unnecessary data transfer, especially on slow networks

3️⃣ Security & Data Privacy
If you send all data to the frontend, sensitive information may be exposed.
Users can manipulate frontend filters, but they cannot change backend queries.

4️⃣ Database Efficiency (Faster Queries)
If we filter on the frontend, we fetch everything from the database → Slow.
If we filter on the backend, we use database queries (WHERE, LIMIT) → Faster performance

✅ Query parameters always come after the ? in a URL and multiple parameters are separated by &.
